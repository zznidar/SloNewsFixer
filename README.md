Make correct use of your screen real estate on certain websites

## MMC
Some images, particulary GIF-animations, are too wide. They spread further than the screen size. This causes the whole website to scroll left-right on mobile devices.
They are not wrapped in `<figure>` elements, thus the `width=100%` does not apply to them.

This extension fixes this by wrapping them in figure with appropriate class.

## 24ur
On the main website, some titles are cut off by ellipsis, even though there's still more than enough space for the missing word in the current line.

This extension retrieves full titles and shows them whole.
